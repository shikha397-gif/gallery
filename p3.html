            <h2>"Architecture is the learned game, correct and magnificent, of forms assembled in light." — Le Corbusier</h2>
            <p>"Architecture stands as a testament to human creativity and engineering brilliance. From towering skyscrapers to ancient temples, each structure tells a story. Arches, domes, and intricate details blend art with functionality. Every building is a masterpiece, shaped by vision and craftsmanship."</p>

            <h2>"Buildings, too, are children of Earth and Sun." — Frank Lloyd Wright</h2>
            <p>"Glass and steel rise toward the sky, reflecting the pulse of a modern city. Sharp angles, bold designs, and sleek facades define contemporary innovation. Urban landscapes are constantly evolving, blending technology with artistry. The skyline is a dynamic expression of progress and ambition."</p>

            <h2>"Architecture should speak of its time and place, but yearn for timelessness." — Frank Gehry</h2>
            <p>"Historic cathedrals, grand palaces, and ancient ruins whisper tales of the past. Stone-carved details and majestic columns showcase the skill of past civilizations. Time may pass, but these structures remain, preserving heritage and history. Each brick and beam carries the essence of generations before us."</p>

            <h2>"To create, one must first question everything." — Eileen Gray</h2>
            <p>"Architecture is more than buildings; it's the art of shaping spaces with purpose. Light, shadows, and symmetry create an atmosphere of elegance and balance. Every curve and corner serves both function and aesthetic beauty. A well-designed structure is where form meets meaning, inspiring all who enter."</p>
